📘 What Can a Young Man Say About the World
This is the official page for my first book: "What Can a Young Man Say About the World", written by me, Ramon, at the age of 20 — shortly after I arrived in Europe alone, without money, but full of dreams.

The purpose of this page is to share my book with the world for free, to inspire others, and to prove that it's possible to create something meaningful even in difficult times.
